### About Project

Developed a 2D autonomous driving simulator using Pygame and the NEAT algorithm.
The project allowed users to create custom maps in MS Paint, with the simulator's car
learning to navigate these tracks autonomously. It includes collision detection through
enhanced radar systems and fine-tuning neural network parameters.
